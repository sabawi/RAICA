## 🎓 How It Works

The Business Intelligence Agent executes a 6-step analysis pipeline:

1. **Market Research** (Step 1/6) - Gathers news, web data, and academic papers
2. **Financial Analysis** (Step 2/6) - Analyzes company financials and stock performance
3. **Document Analysis** (Step 3/6) - Interrogates company documents for insights
4. **Competitor Analysis** (Step 4/6) - Compares competitors and market positioning
5. **Dashboard Creation** (Step 5/6) - Generates KPI dashboard with metrics
6. **Strategy Recommendations** (Step 6/6) - Creates actionable strategic guidance

Each step can succeed or fail independently (graceful degradation), ensuring the analysis continues even if optional components fail.

## 💡 Tips for Best Results

1. **Be Specific**: Provide specific company names and competitor lists for focused analysis
2. **Use Real Documents**: Provide actual company documents (PDFs, reports) for deeper insights
3. **Monitor Logs**: Watch the log output to understand what the agent is analyzing
4. **Review First**: Review the generated report before sharing with stakeholders
5. **Schedule Wisely**: Use weekly scheduling for ongoing monitoring, not daily (reduces API usage)
